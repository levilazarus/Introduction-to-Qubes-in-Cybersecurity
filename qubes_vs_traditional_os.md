# Qubes vs. Traditional OS

| Topic | Traditional OS | Qubes OS |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Isolation | Process-level | VM-level (stronger boundaries) |
| Risk Containment | Lateral movement easier | Breach contained within a VM |
| App Installation | Global to system | Template-based; AppVMs inherit |
| Daily Workflow | Single trust domain | Multiple, colorâ€‘coded domains |

**Takeaway:** Qubes trades some convenience for **substantially improved isolation**.
