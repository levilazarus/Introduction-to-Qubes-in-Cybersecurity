# Introduction to Qubes in Cybersecurity

## üìå Overview
This project explores **Qubes OS**, a security-first operating system that uses **virtual machines (VMs)** to isolate tasks into separate security domains. 
We implemented a segmented workflow for **penetration testing**, **anonymous browsing**, and **Linux-based secure operations** using **AppVMs** and **Whonix**.

## üõ† Tools Used
- **Qubes OS** ‚Äî domain isolation & compartmentalization
- **Whonix** ‚Äî Tor-routed, privacy-preserving browsing
- **Ubuntu AppVMs** ‚Äî Linux-based application VMs
- **Metasploit** ‚Äî vulnerability assessment & exploitation framework
- **Virtual Machines** ‚Äî sandboxed environments for security tasks

## üöÄ Objectives
- Understand Qubes **architecture** (dom0, TemplateVMs, AppVMs, Disposable VMs).
- Configure **AppVMs** for secure application usage and pentesting.
- Integrate **Whonix** for anonymous, Tor-based browsing.
- Run **Metasploit** in a dedicated testing VM.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of **domain isolation** and **task compartmentalization**.

## üìä Outcomes (from the study period)
- Demonstrated reduced risk via **least-trust inter-VM boundaries**.
- Kept testing activity **isolated** from everyday workflows.
- Showed practical benefits of Qubes for **operational security** in labs.
